          I am a frontend developer who loves good user experiences. I have a
          good grasp of technologies such as Javascript(ES6+), React, DOM, JSON,
          HTML5 & CSS3. Creating good user experiences and solving problems is
          something I find interesting and enjoy bringing new ideas to life.
